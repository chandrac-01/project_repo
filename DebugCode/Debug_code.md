**What you will learn**

In this lab, you will gain an understanding of how to debug code in JavaScript. You will learn about try and
catch blocks and gain insight into how and where to use these blocks to make sure that your code is running smoothly.

**Learning objectives**

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. User input: Provides two input fields for users to enter numerical values.
2. Operation execution: Multiplies the two input values when the "Perform Operation" button is clicked.
3. Error handling: Checks if the entered values are valid numbers before performing the multiplication operation.
   If the values are not valid numbers, it displays an error message instead of the result.
5. Debugging: Includes a debugger statement within the multiply() function to pause execution and allow developers to inspect the code,
   variables, and execution flow using browser Developer Tools.
